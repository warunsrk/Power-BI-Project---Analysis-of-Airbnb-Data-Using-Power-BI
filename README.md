• The Reviews (Reviews.csv) dataset contains information about reviews left for Airbnb listings, while the Listings (Listings.csv) dataset contains all relevant details about the listed stays. Comprehensive descriptions of each column can be found in their respective data dictionary files (Listings_data_dictionary.csv and Reviews_data_dictionary.csv)
